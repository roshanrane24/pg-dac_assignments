            A spy from Westalis, who has extraordinary combat, memory, and
            information processing capabilities. He uses various faces and
            names for each mission, though he is generally known by his code
            name, "Twilight." His most recent mission, Operation Strix,
            requires him to enroll a child in a prestigious school that needs
            "both parents to be present." Hence, he creates a false family by
            adopting Anya and marrying Yor. He is skilled in cooking and
            cleaning. As "Loid Forger," he camouflaged himself as a
            psychiatrist at Berlint General Hospital. Formerly a war orphan,
            he became a spy to create a "world where children do not cry."

            A professional assassin nicknamed "Thorn Princess," who disguises
            herself as a female employee at Berlint City Hall. Yor's maiden
            name before marrying Loid is Briar (ブライア, Buraia). She is 27
            years old. She agrees to a fake marriage without knowing Loid's
            true background and believes that Anya is his actual daughter
            from a previous marriage. Being an assassin, Yor is good at
            cleaning, but not with the other household chores, particularly
            cooking. Thus, Loid does most of the cooking, though she has
            recently started learning from her coworker. She has a younger
            brother named Yuri, who is a civil servant and is a bit too
            attached to her.

            A young girl who can read the thoughts of other people, Anya is
            the only one who knows the overall situation of her family. She
            appears to be around 4 or 5 years old, but claims to be 6 as Loid
            needed to adopt a 6 year old as part of his mission. Originally
            an experimental human test subject dubbed "Subject 007"
            (被検体007), she escaped because she was frustrated with a life
            where she could not behave like a child. She then named herself
            "Anya." Due to her ability, Anya is not good with crowds. In
            addition, because Anya has not received a proper education, she
            is not good at studying and makes up for it by reading other
            peoples' minds for answers. However, it appears she can not use
            her ability during a new moon. She likes spy anime and thinks
            anything involving "secrets" and "missions" are exciting.
