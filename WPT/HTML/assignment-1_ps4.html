        <h1>Eren Yeager</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
        <b>Eren Yeager</b> (Japanese: エレン・イェーガー, Hepburn:
        Eren Yēgā), named Eren Jaeger in the subtitled and dubbed 
        versions of the anime, is a fictional character and the
        protagonist of the Attack on Titan manga series created by
        Hajime Isayama. Eren is a teenager who swears revenge on
        enormous creatures known as Titans that devoured his mother
        and destroyed his town in the Shiganshina district in Wall
        Maria. In order to defeat the Titans, Eren enlists in the
        Military and joins the Survey Corps—an elite group of
        soldiers who fight Titans outside the walls and also study
        the physiology of Titans in order to know what they are
        fighting. As the story progresses, Eren gains the power of
        becoming a Titan later identified as "Attack Titan"
        (進撃の巨人, Shingeki no Kyojin). Eren uses this power to
        give Humanity an advantage to defeat their enemies while
        learning of their true identity and their own history. After
        a three-year time skip in chapter 91 "The Other Side of the
        Ocean", Eren takes on an antagonistic role in the story as he
        becomes the world's enemy, unleashing thousands of colossal
        titans onto the world in an event called the Rumbling in
        order to exterminate all humanity outside of his home island,
        Paradis. He has also appeared in other related media
        including anime and video games.</p>
        <p>
        Isayama created Eren with the idea of a character whose fears
        and dreams were relatable but often clashed with his own
        darkness, resulting into multiple changes to his
        characterization. In the anime adaptation of the series, Eren
        has been voiced by Yūki Kaji in Japanese and Bryce Papenbrook
        in English. Both of these actors found difficulties in
        employing different types of voices based on how Eren grows
        up across the narrative. In the live -action film
        adaptations, he is portrayed by Haruma Miura.

        <p>
        Japanese actor Yūki Kaji commented on how it was important
        that he should voice Eren's Titan form because he believes it
        is an extension of the character. He had a meal with Isayama
        after he visited the recording studio and the manga artist
        told him he found Eren quite a difficult character but
        complimented Kaji by saying "You know Eren already", which
        gave him confidence.[12] Eren's characterization was briefly
        altered for the English dub of the series making him self
        -reflective and eloquent in some scenes.[13] Kaji described
        Eren for the second season as a person who never changes
        despite his growth, finding this trait important for the
        drama. The staff and him did not want to change the way Kaji
        changed Eren's portrayal in the making of the second season.

        English voice actor Bryce Papenbrook got excited when he got
        the role of Eren as he was a fan of the show before it was
        announced that it would be dubbed into English. As a result,
        he viewed this as an advantage as he managed to understand
        the character beforehand.[15] For example, he could
        understand the delivery of several lines because he already
        knew of the anime's series of twists. Additionally, he saw
        himself prepared for the role's pressure due to his previous
        works in popular anime.

        <h3>In Atack on Titan</h3>
        <p>
        Eren Yeager is introduced as a ten-year-old residing in the town of
        Shiganshina who dreams of joining the Survey Corps in order to explore
        the outside world beyond the walls. A year prior to the events of the
        story, accompanying his father Grisha to meet her parents, Eren helps
        Mikasa Ackerman in dispatching her kidnappers, while developing his
        ideology at a young age.[19] When the Titans invade Shiganshina, Eren
        is forced to watch his mother be devoured by one of the Titans and
        thus vows to kill every Titan henceforth.[20] Eren then enlist himself
        in the military.[20] During his first mission at Trost, Eren
        sacrifices himself to save his friend Armin Arlert from being
        swallowed by a bearded Titan.[21] Eren manages to transform into a
        Titan himself, proving his newfound strength worthy to fight for
        mankind.[22] Eren earns a place in the Special Operations Squad, a
        branch of Survey Corps under Captain Levi.[23][24] Eren is hunted by a
        female Titan but is saved by Levi and Mikasa. The Titan is later
        revealed to be his classmate Annie Leonhart, who is defeated by Eren
        but freezes herself. Upon being chased by more of Annie's allies, Eren
        awakens a power known as the "Founding Titan" (始祖の巨人, Shiso no
        Kyojin), which he subconsciously uses to direct a group of Titans to
        attack them
        </p>
        <p>
        Soon after, Eren is sent with his friends to an isolated village while
        preparations are made for a campaign to retake Wall Maria. Eren is
        then captured by Rod Reiss, who reveals the Founding was originally in
        his family for years since their ancestor Karl Fritz created the
        walls, and that the Reiss family used it to rule until it was stolen
        by Grisha. Grisha is revealed to be responsible for Eren becoming a
        Titan and was eaten by his son in the past unconsciously. Eren's
        classmate Krista Lenz, who is actually Rod's child Historia, refuses
        to aid her father and frees Eren. Eren and the Survey Corps depart to
        Shiganshina to reclaim Wall Maria and defeat an army of Titans led by
        Zeke, the Beast Titan, and his subordinates Bertolt and Reiner.[26]
        With Shiganshina secured,[27] Eren and his friends learn of Grisha's
        past: Zeke is revealed to be Eren's half brother and Grisha's first
        son, and they are revealed to have originated in another nation named
        Marley. They learn that humanity exists beyond the walls and that
        their true enemy is Marley, while they live on an island called
        Paradis Island, and are a race called Eldians (specifically the
        "Subjects of Ymir"), descendants of the original titan shifter Ymir
        Fritz and that in the past as her power split into the Nine Titans
        that would be passed down to her people it was used to conquer and
        subjugate many races and nations in the past, including Marley who
        overthrew Eldia and took control of Seven of the Nine Titans, before
        oppressing and demeaning Eldians left on the continental mainland and
        using them as holders of the titan powers acquired to conquer and
        subjugate other nations as the Eldian Empire had once done in the
        past. Eren learns that he has a limited lifespan as a side effect of
        being a holder of two of the Nine Titans' power, including the titular
        "Attack Titan" (進撃の巨人, Shingeki no Kyojin),[28] along with the
        Founding Titan, only having 8 years left to live.
