1. import day14.1 as existing maven project to revise: bean life cycle + setter base D.I
  (look at dependency, dependent classes n bean config xml file + tester)
  Modifiy scope / lazy-init n understand bean's life cycle

## Hands On

1. You can either import day12_lab or refer to your own Maven, Hibernate based web project.

2. You can copy all java beans n JSPs from earlier work.

3. Everyone MUST complete hibernate based DAO layers for user dao, topic dao & tutorial dao
  as per our reference case study(CMS), for both admin n customer role.

4. If you don't want to test entire project :
  write JUnit 5 test cases , as explained earlier.
  Keep dao layers tested.
  You are going to require them for integration of spring n hibernate.
