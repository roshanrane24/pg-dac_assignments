# Day 9

1. import day9_cms , as java project . Trace complete flow to revise JSP---JavaBean--DAO--POJO---DB layers
2. import day9_hibernate , as existing maven project , to revise hibernate architecture in detail.
3. If majority completes this revision , we will add new fresh assignment later.

4. Optional assignment (after complete revision)
    Create fresh project day9_lab, maven based. (You can copy it from day8_hibernate or create it from scratch)

    4.1 As per the "layers in hibernate " diagram , add config xml file , create hibernate utils n test bootstrapping of hibernate framework.

    4.2 Take a look at this table.
        ```
        create table books(
            id int(5) primary key auto_increment,
            title varchar(20) unique,
            author varchar(20),
            category varchar(20),
            price double);
        ```

    NOTE :
        In 1st version of the POJO, create Book POJO mapped to this DB table.
        In 2nd version (after learning E-R), we will create a separate table for book category:
            (category_id, name), with Category 1  ------ * Book (one-many)

    4.3 Create IBookDao n hibernate based implementation class, to add the books to the bookstore.

    4.4. Test it with the tester.
 

COMPLETELY OPTIONAL !!!!!!!!!!!!
    4.3 Take a look at CMS tables : Map them to POJOs , w/o E-R.
