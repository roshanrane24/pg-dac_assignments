# Q1 Difference between kernel and OS 

| Operating System                                             | Kernel                                                                                               |

| It is a System Software                                      | It is a system software which is part of OS                                                          |
| Provides interface between user & hardware                   | Provides interface between application & hardware                                                    |
| Provides protection & security                               | Main purpose is to provide process management, task management, memory management, device management |
| It is first program to load when computer boots              | It is first program to load when OS load                                                             |
| All system needs OS to run                                   | All OSs need kernel to run                                                                           |
| Multiuser OS, Multiprocessor OS, Realtime OS, Distributed OS | Monolithic & micro kernel                                                                            |

# Q2 Write one-liner on Type of OS with examples

## Batch OS
In batch OS every user prepares their jobs on an offline device feed it to computer for processing.
eg. Multiple Virtual Storage (MVS)

## Distributed OS
Distributed systems use many processors located in different machines to provide very fast computation.
eg. LOCUS, MICROS

## Multitasking OS
Multitasking OS shares processing time among multiple process by users at same time on same computer.
eg. Linux, Windows XP, Windows 7, Windows 10

## Network OS
Network Operating System runs on a server. It provides the capability to manage data, user, groups, security, application, and other networking functions.
eg. Linux, Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2019, Solaris, BSD

## Real-OS
Real time OS has very small latency for processing & responding to inputs.
eg. Military Software Systems, Space Software Systems.

## Mobile OS
Mobile OSs are designed to run on smartphones, tablets & wearable devices.
eg. Android, iOS, Symbian, Blackberry OS
